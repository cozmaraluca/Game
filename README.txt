#Game
This is a JavaScript Game. A rain of healthy food and fast food is falling. The cart must only collect the healthy food
to increase the score. Any pizza or burger in the cart means a lost life. If all three lives are lost it’s game over.
The player controls a cart using their mouse cursor. 
The objective of the game is to catch healthy food items such as salad and pineapple while avoiding fast food items such as pizza and burgers. 
The player’s score increases when they catch healthy food and decreases when they catch fast food. 
The player has three lives, represented by hearts, and the game ends when all lives are lost. If the player reaches a score of 10 or more, they win the game.
There are functions to handle different aspects of the game such as creating falling elements, checking for collisions between the cart and falling elements, and handling collisions. 
Event listeners are used to handle user input and update the game state accordingly.
